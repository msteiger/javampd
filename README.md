#JavaMPD library

This is a fork of [TheJavaShop's JavaMPD](http://www.thejavashop.net/javampd) version 4.1 which was released in May 2012.
Unfortunately, it seems that the code is no longer maintained there.

I forked the lib primarily to be able to commit *bugfixes*. See commit messages to get details on the changes I've made.

The original source code is available at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/javampd/)
